# Western Showdown

You meet your opponent for a duel at high noon. A timer counts down and you draw and fire as fast as you can... without missing.

## vs AI

In the vs AI game mode, there is no timer. What happens is that you load in, and both are standing tense and ready. When you reach for the gun, the AI will react and try to shoot you. If you wait too long the AI will attack first.

## vs Human

Networked, you are dropped into a duel and the timer counts downt o start. At 0 you are free to shoot them whenever you want.

Potential mode where you start back to back and walk a few paces away and turn and shoot.

## other ideas

Other modes might involve dialogue tree with potentially hostile ai opponent at the saloon who goes for his gun if you say the wrong thing, and you have to react fast enough to get him before he gets you. Or a scene where you enter a saloon looking for a man with a bounty and aren't sure who the hostiles are and who aren't. etc.
