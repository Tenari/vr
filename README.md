# Space Game Premise

Space trading game in wild-west asteroid belt colonies setting, where pirate attacks are cockpit fights.

Okay so I actually don't know why I want to make this game, what it's pull/attraction is, but I just do. The idea came to me after playing [End Space](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2434361173248640/) and not liking it very much. Basically I want to combine Space Engineers with Pardus. So, have it look and feel a lot like Space Engineers, but be focused on trading and combat and teamwork like Pardus instead of on mining and building like in Space Engineers.

This game could have a lot of game mechanics potentially, but would be pretty limited initially. Core mechanics are loading your ship with trade goods (3-D box tetris?), flying your ship to a destination, and fighting off pirates along the way. Ship upgrades, weapon upgrades, cloaking devices, boarding enemy ships and manually shooting them are all things that could be fun to add.

# Wizard Game Premise

Literal tower defense by a hermit wizard using hand guestures to cast various magical spells.

The game has two stages: Prep and Combat. Prep involves you sitting in your wizard chamber at your wizard desk with tons of scrolls, and scrying the forest to see what monsters are coming to attack your hermit wizard tower in the woods. When you see them, then you gotta look em up to see what their weaknesses are. Then when you see that the goblins are weak to lightning bolts you gotta find the scrols for your lightning spells and choose which one(s) you wanna learn. And then you gotta practice the hand motions/button combinations/(maybe)words to say to get the spell to work, because once you get to combat stage, you're on your own. No reference material, or guides, just you and the ability to cast whatever spells you know. Key to making this work is the complexity/fun of the magic system, and making it so that there are no obvious silver bullet spells that you can just learn once and do every time.

I like this idea because it makes "learning a spell" not a game mechanic with a spell slot limit, but an actual function of your actual brain and you actually practicing the motions. Plus it (should) feel like you are actually casting the spell, which is good for immersion.

# Cowboy game premise

The western standoff. You meet your opponent for a duel at high noon. A timer counts down and you draw and fire as fast as you can... without missing. Other modes might involve dialogue tree with potentially hostile ai opponent at the saloon who goes for his gun if you say the wrong thing, and you have to react fast enough to get him before he gets you. Or a scene where you enter a saloon looking for a man with a bounty and aren't sure who the hostiles are and who aren't. etc.
