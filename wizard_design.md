# A Wizard's Tower

You are a hermit wizard defending his tower against the various monsters and bad men who live in your forest.

## Basic Gameplay Loop

You are in your laboratory, scrying the nearby forest and you see the approaching monsters + how far away they are, which starts the timer. You have until the timer runs out to research the monster's weaknesses and learn/practice the necessary spells to defeat them. When the timer runs out, ready or not, the next wave arrives and you go to the top of your tower where you attempt to cast the spells you (hopefully) learned at the oncoming monsters and defend your tower. If they break down your front door, you lose. If they all die, you win and go back to the lab to do it all over again.

## Core Mechanic

Casting the spells requires complex hand motions/button combos/voice commands/etc. Learning the spells is non-trivial and thus successfully casting the right spell at the monsters is rewarding.
